## _GrowFlow_ â€“ Phoenix Code Challenge

This application was started by using the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) CLI.

> ### Points of Interest

- It is designed to work offline.

- It uses a custom Service Worker to cache the application shell, assets and API calls after initial installation.

- It uses PouchDB to queue any new employees offline, and then sync them when back online.

- It uses a proxy API server to get around the issue of CORS not being enabled on the Leviathan API.

> ### Steps for Setting Up

1. Install Node v14.4.0 using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (_node version manager_).<br />

   ```sh
   $ nvm install v14.4.0
   $ nvm use
   ```

2. Clone the [Phoenix repository](https://github.com/lanegreg/phoenix-ui) and install dependencies.<br />

   ```sh
   $ git clone https://github.com/lanegreg/phoenix-ui.git
   $ cd phoenix-ui/ && npm install
   ```

3. Change into the `/proxy-server` folder and install dependencies.<br />

   ```sh
   $ cd proxy-server/ && npm install
   ```

4. Install [PouchDB Server](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb-server) globally.<br />

   ```sh
   $ npm install -g pouchdb-server

   // Underneath the /proxy-server folder create a /pouch-db folder.
   $ mkdir pouch-db
   ```

   <br />

> ### Steps for Running

1. In a terminal, start the PouchDB server inside the `/proxy-server` folder.<br />
   **Note:** _PouchDB will setup it's folder stucture based on the folder you start in._<br />

   ```sh
   $ cd proxy-server/ && npm run start:pouch

   // ...or with `yarn`
   $ cd proxy-server/ && yarn start:pouch
   ```

2. In a second terminal, from the same `/proxy-server` folder, start up the proxy server.<br />

   ```sh
   $ cd proxy-server/ && npm run start

   // ...or with `yarn`
   $ cd proxy-server/ && yarn start
   ```

3. In a third terminal, start up the Phoenix application.<br />

   ```sh
   $ npm run start:prod

   // ...or with `yarn`
   $ yarn start:prod
   ```

> ### Problems with Leviathan API

- Inconsistent API design between the different entities (e.g. Employee, Customer, Order).
- Inconsistent naming convention used for property names on entity objects.
- Misspelled property names on entity objects.
- Using the `User` & `Key` in the URL is _not_ a good practice for [security reasons](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/118975/is-it-safe-to-include-an-api-key-in-a-requests-url).
- The API is not `CORS` enabled which creates a problem if you are to access the API from the browser.
